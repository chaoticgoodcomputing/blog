In 2022, I graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in [Quantitative Analysis of Markets & Organizations](https://eccles.utah.edu/programs/undergraduate/academics/majors/qamo/) (QAMO, more-or-less [[tags/economics/index|quantitative economics]]).

Words cannot describe how much I appreciate the mentorship I received from my professors - especially Scott Schaefer, the program director who was incredibly kind in providing a level of flexibility that, frankly, was the only reason I was able to graduate while working full-time.

That said, I *do* wish the name of the degree wasn't such a pain in the ass to type out.
