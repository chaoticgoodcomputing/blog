In college, my area of focus during [[qamo|my economics degree]] was **non-market environments**, which encompass the areas of economics where money isn't used for moral or practical reasons.

A presentation I'm particularly proud of is a presentation on David Gale and Lloyd Shapley's 1962 paper [College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall09/papers/galeshapley.pdf)

This presentation happened at a personally odd time during a globally odd year, and - due to the practical limitation of only having my iPad available while I was in-patient at the University of Utah - was the first time I started using [[doodles]] in the vast majority of my presentations.

There are a few things that were cut for the presentation for time - in particular, the incredibly interesting concept of **matchmaking lattices**. Eventually, I'd like to include some additional written resources here on the topic, because it's pretty cool. One of the cut slides is available [[some1-entry|here.]]

The absolutely incredible [Dr. Allison Stashko](https://sites.google.com/view/allisonstashko/home) is the only reason this presentation was possible - she was incredibly kind and encouraging during a difficult period, and is in large part the reason why non-market environments are my primary interest in economics. ^635c68
