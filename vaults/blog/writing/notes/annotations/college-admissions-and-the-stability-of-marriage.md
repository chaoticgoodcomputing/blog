In that case, you could imagine that all possible configurations — stable or unstable — stacked on top of each other to form a 3D grid, or *lattice*, of match configurations. All of the possible 2D grids stacked like a big crystalline structure.\n\nFrom that lattice, you can slide out all of the unstable configurations (because, obviously, they suck and don't mean anything), leaving us with a **stable match lattice**.\n\nThe even more interesting thing is - now that you have that stable match lattice, what *exactly* is in it? That's where this particular part gets super zesty - \"Every applicant is **at least as well off [...] as he would be under any other stable assignment**\"\n\nGale-Shapley's stable match algorithm takes in two sets of people — in the case of this paper, men and women — which you can think of as the \"assigner\" and the \"assignee\", the former of which makes the proposals and the latter who accepts or declines them. Think of it as a formula:\n\n```\nmatches = gale_shapley(assigners, assignees)\n```\n\n**Gale-Shapley is a noncommutative operation that optimizes the outcome for the *assigners* set**.\n\nImagine you have a set of four men and four women, and you want to measure how \"good\" a matchmaking configuration is. You could imagine that the best-case scenario is that everybody ends up with their #1 choice, and the worst-case scenario is that everybody ends up with their #4 choice. We can use that as a baseline for measuring the \"goodness\" of the matchmaking.\n\nLet's say, in some given matchmaking pair, everybody gets their first choice — the best case. If you were to add up everybody's result (1st place) and average it by the number of people (8 people) you'd get a value of `1`. On the flip side, for the worst-case, you'd get a value of `4` - ultimately being able to answer the question \"*On average*, how well were people placed?\"\n\nUltimately, if you take an analysis of the average placement of the assigner group (in this case, men), you'll see that **the assigner group's average in Gale-Shapley is the highest of all possible stable configurations**.\n\nUltimately, if you were to rank-order all possible stable matching sets on the matchmaking lattice on a spectrum of \"Benefits Group A\" to \"Benefits Group B\", the outputs of `gale_shapley(A, B)` and `gale_shapley(B, A)` calculate the ends of the lattice.\n\nThis also implies a bit of a potential ethical issue. Depending on the context, there is an active decision made for \"who gets better outcomes\" by simply putting them into the algorithm first. Even within this paper, the marriage example itself generates the stable marriage output that provides men with the optimal output.\n\nUltimately, matchmaking is still something that interests me deeply, and I'm hoping that CGC (either the consulting side or development side) puts me in a position to keep working with these very interesting, *very* cool situations.","updated":"2024-03-14T22:51:55.217Z","document":{"title":"College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage","link":[{"href":"urn:x-pdf:dd0c1fc592ad4dea981aaf84679261c3"},{"href":"https://www.math.utoronto.ca/mccann/assignments/477/GaleShapley62.pdf"}],"documentFingerprint":"dd0c1fc592ad4dea981aaf84679261c3"},"uri":"https://www.math.utoronto.ca/mccann/assignments/477/GaleShapley62.pdf","target":[{"source":"https://www.math.utoronto.ca/mccann/assignments/477/GaleShapley62.pdf","selector":[{"type":"TextPositionSelector","start":15201,"end":15368},{"type":"TextQuoteSelector","exact":"THEOREM  2.
