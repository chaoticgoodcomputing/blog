As an addendum to the [[literal-scratch-piano|Scratch Piano Application]], I also around the same time cooked up an implementation of QuickSort. At my partner's recent swim meet I sat next to [[2024-03-02#Today's Report|a couple kids who've been learning Scratch]] and they were showing off some games they'd made.

i was shocked - when it was my turn to show off, they didn't seem very impressed by this.

honestly, the sort isn't the weird thing - it's the code itself that makes me, with 6 years of hindsight, think "...why the fuck would I make this?"
